# Rain Prediction Application üåßÔ∏è  

## Overview  
This project is an end-to-end machine learning application designed to predict whether it will rain the next day in Australia. It is built using Python and Flask and includes a Power BI dashboard for visualizing insights derived from the dataset.  

The application processes historical weather data, applies machine learning algorithms, and provides predictions while enabling users to explore insights interactively through Power BI visualizations.  

---

## Features  
- **Rain Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of rain for the next day based on user input or existing data.  
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Offers rich and interactive visualizations to analyze trends and patterns in the dataset.  
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, deployment, and visualization.  

---

## Dataset  
- **Source**: Australian weather dataset.  
- **Description**: Contains historical weather observations and rain data used for feature engineering and prediction.  

---

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Framework**: Flask  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn  
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI  
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Deployment**: Flask for backend integration  

---

## Application Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.  
   - Splits data into training and testing sets.  

2. **Model Training**:  
   - Trained a classification model to predict rain using features such as temperature, humidity, and wind.  

3. **Prediction**:  
   - Allows users to input weather conditions to predict rain.  

4. **Power BI Dashboard**:  
   - Visualizations include:  
     - Rainfall trends over time.  
     - Correlation heatmaps.  
     - Feature importance and distribution analysis.  

5. **Deployment**:  
   - Flask serves the application, enabling interaction via a web interface.
